# Campaign App
It is a simple web application based on Spring backend and Rect frontend. The H2 database was also used.
# Overview 
The user has a home page for his access, on which he has a list of currently added campaigns with buttons responsible for editing and deleting campaigns. The user can also go to the new campaign form using the "Add" button at the top of the screen. The data in the form is pre-filled as required. 

The main entity has data validation and appropriate exception handling. Several unit tests were also run for the application.
